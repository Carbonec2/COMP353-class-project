- Put new pages in the 'pages' folder
- The CSS should have the same name as the page
- Link to pages: "index.php?page=myPage" (So the header is automatically set, the JS files included, the CSS file too, see index.php for more information)
- Interface the database through TDGs (Avoids spaghetti code for interfacing the database)
