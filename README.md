## Créé dans le cadre du cours COMP353 (Bases de données), été 2018, à l'université Concordia
## Project made for the COMP353 class (Database), Summer 2018, Concordia University

Warning: Some things done here were done for the strict purpose of the class, and are definitely not recommended in a production environment.

Ex: Not hashing the passwords stored in the database, sending all the content of a table to the client, including those passwords, etc.

- Put new pages in the 'pages' folder
- The CSS should have the same name as the page
- Link to pages: "index.php?page=myPage" (So the header is automatically set, the JS files included, the CSS file too, see index.php for more information)
- Interface the database through TDGs (Avoids spaghetti code for interfacing the database)
